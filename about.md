I'm sorry there isn't much about myself here yet. I'd love to talk more about my professional life, projects and hobbies but I haven't had much time in the last few days. I intent to update this page more often so please stay tuned. ;)

My name is Fernando Silveira, I'm 35 years old, married, I have two wonderful children and I'm a geek. I'm a software developer that loves [Linux](http://www.kernel.org), [command line interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and (of course) computer programming.

I've been using Linux as my preferred operating system since 1997 and C/C++ as my main programming language since 2001. I've never been very good with GUI (graphical user interfaces) and my desktops/workstations are "ugly". And by "ugly" I mean [2 big LCD screens](http://www.flickr.com/photos/swrh/5527205850/) with a black background and lots of xterms. No wallpapers, graphical effects or icons. Here is a screenshot of my desktop in 2004:

Believe me: the only two differences between this screenshot that is 12 years old and my current desktop is that I use a [smaller font](http://packages.qa.debian.org/x/xfonts-nexus.html) and the screen resolution is much bigger. I still use [FVWM](http://www.fvwm.org/) as window manager, [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) as my preferred editor, [Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org/) as my distro of choice and still have no wallpaper. Here's a more recent screenshot:

You can find in my [about.me](http://about.me/{{ site.aboutme_username }}) page links to more sites and social networks I'm in. My e-mail is on the bottom of every page of this site and you can write me whenever you want. I'll be happy to answer you promptly.

Thanks for reading! ;)
