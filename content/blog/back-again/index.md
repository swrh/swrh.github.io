After hitting the wall in a mock interview I decided to reboot this project. I nailed the offline test I have been given but I failed miserably in the mock interview due to lack of preparation. I feel I need to exercise a lot my coding interview skills and this is what I'm going to do.

Thinking about the [Leonhard][leonhard] project a little bit I feel I need to do something like the [Boost.Test][boost-test] library. It is really useful for testing and I think I might use it in the future in this project. I'm a little reluctant to use a third-party software but I don't think adopting the [Boost][boost] library is going to enable anyone to cheat much in the challenges.
