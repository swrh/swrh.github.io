After chasing after a nice score on Project Euler I decided it isn't motivating me enough. I managed to solved less than 50 problems using C++ and it still didn't made me want to "wake up early in sunday morning" just to code.

I decided to change my challenge to code a C++ game. I tried once to create a simple side scrolling game with some friends but because of some non-technical related problems we failed in the first few weeks, and this time I'll do it by myself. I don't have any graphical design skills but for the purpose of practicing algorithms it doesn't matter. At least for now.

I researched a little and it seems that one of the simplest games to create is a Tetris-like one. It doesn't require collision detection, advanced graphics or complex mathematics so it should be ok to be coded using only C++, [Boost][boost] and a simple graphics library like [SDL][sdl], for example. I don't want to create an awesome game, I just need to have an awesome experience coding something nice, so don't be surprised if the game is almost unusable. ;)

Anyway, the name of the game is [Lozti][lozti] and the name is based in the 5 pieces used in Tetris: *L*, *O*, *Z*, *T* and *I*. The code is published in GitHub and I expect to post the development progress from time to time.

Cya!
